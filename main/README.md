# Introduction

#### MatrixCalculator is a simple matrix calculator. It can perform simple matrix manipulation on an individual matrix of any timension, such as matrix squaring and transposition. MatrixCalculator can also perform operations with two matrices, such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication. This application can be used to perform simple matrix manipulation on large matrices, where doing the work manually will take up too much time. The following documentation will assist users in getting the most out of MatrixCalculator, without losing any progress due to input errors.

# Installation

## Prerequisites

* [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
* Command Line Interface (Command Prompt/PowerShell/Terminal)

## First-Time Setup

1. [Download the MatrixCalculator files](https://github.com/danilabuyuk/MatrixCalculator)
2. Using Command Line Interface, navigate to the "out" folder inside the MatrixCalculator files.
3. Run the following command to start the application: `java main/Main`  

# Instructions

1. Click the "Add Matrix" button on the side of your choice.
2. Insert the number of rows and columns for the desired matrix and press "Add".
   > [!WARNING]
   > The numbers inserted MUST be whole numbers!
3. Insert the desired numbers for each entry of the matrix and press "Input".
   > [!TIP]
   > MatrixCalculator uses double values for matrix values, so the entered values can be extremely precise!
4. Repeat Steps 1-3 for the other side of the calculator if you wish to perform matrix operations on two matrices.
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > You are ready to perform matrix manipulation on the matrix you just inserted! Simply press the button with a desired operation and you will get a pop-up window with a result!
5. Once the second matrix is inserted, a middle section will appear, showing matrix manipulation buttons. Click the button with a desired operation.
   > [!CAUTION]
   > While the application is designed to not crash, DO NOT PRESS THE MIDDLE SECTION BUTTONS BEFORE FINISHING ENTERING THE SECOND MATRIX! It can lead to unexpected results.
